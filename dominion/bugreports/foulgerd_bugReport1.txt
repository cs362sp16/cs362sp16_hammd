Bug:
initializeGame() does not deal the correct number of cards to each player.
The function succesfully deals cards from player 1's deck to their hand but fails to repeat this process for the other players.

Severity:
Medium severity. The current implementation deals cards to players at the start of their respective turns. Although this works, it does not follow the rules for Dominion.

Priority:
Medium priority. Since the bug contrasts the rules of the game it should be fixed sooner than later.

Suggested fix:
Deal cards to each player during initializeGame(). Change any logic required to ensure that drawing cards occurs during the correct game phase.
