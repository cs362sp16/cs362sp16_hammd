Bug:
When running full game tests of dominion I found that playing the remodel card was returning with an error status.

Severity:
High severity. Any game involving the remodel kingdom card could fail during its card effect.

Priority:
Medium priority. The card itself could be temporarily disabled from play while the bug was being resolved.

Suggested fix:
Since my test only checked for an error status code I can't suggest any direct action that would resolve the bug. More testing is needed.
